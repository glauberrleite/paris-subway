# Paris Subway
Paris Subway is an AI toy-problem where the system should indicate the fastest path between two stations. To solve this we have a map and a table of distances between stations. So, we will be using heuristics in A* search algorithm.

Supposing that:

* The train's average velocity is 30km/h;
* We have 4 subway lines;
* We spend 4 minutes to change between subway lines in a station.
